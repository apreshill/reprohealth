Excerpts from Gapminder and World Bank data with indicators for women's health

# Data sources

- [World Bank: Life expectancy at birth, female (years)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.FE.IN)

- [World Bank: Contraceptive prevalence, any methods (% of women ages 15-49)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CONU.ZS)

- [World Bank: Fertility rate, total (births per woman)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)

- [World Bank: Wanted fertility rate (births per woman)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.WFRT)

- [World Bank: Births attended by skilled health staff (% of total)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.BRTC.ZS)

- [World Bank: Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT)

- [World Bank: School enrollment, primary and secondary (gross), gender parity index (GPI)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ENR.PRSC.FM.ZS)
  - "The Gender Parity Index (GPI) indicates parity between girls and boys. Gender parity index for gross enrollment ratio in primary and secondary education is the ratio of girls to boys enrolled at primary and secondary levels in public and private schools. A GPI of less than 1 suggests girls are more disadvantaged than boys in learning opportunities and a GPI of greater than 1 suggests the other way around. Eliminating gender disparities in education would help increase the status and capabilities of women."
